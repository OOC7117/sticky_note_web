# Sticky Notes Web App

A lightweight sticky notes web app that runs entirely in the browser. Create, edit, delete, and search through notes while they persist across sessions via `localStorage`.

## Features

- ✍️ Add new notes with a title and rich text area content.
- ✏️ Edit existing notes in place with a single click.
- 🗑️ Delete notes you no longer need.
- 🔍 Instantly search across note titles and bodies.
- 💾 Automatic persistence using browser `localStorage`.
- 📱 Responsive layout that scales from mobile to desktop.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Your notes are stored in the browser, so they stay available the next time you visit.

## Development

If you prefer to run a local development server, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
